# clipper2

This repository is a fork of the c++ part of Angus Johnson's Clipper library. See:
* http://www.angusj.com/delphi/
* https://sourceforge.net/projects/polyclipping/
* https://sourceforge.net/projects/polyclipping/files/

This repository only forks the c++ part of the sandbox version of Clipper2:
* https://sourceforge.net/projects/polyclipping/files/Alpha-Beta%20Releases/

The main focus of this is only to keep track of smaller changes neccessary to make things work.
